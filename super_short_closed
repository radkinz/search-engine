He became Emir of Mosul in 1170 after the death of his father Qutb adDin Mawdud. Saif had been chosen as the successor under the advice of eunuch Abd alMasish, who wanted to keep the effective rule in lieu of the young emir the disinherited son of Mawdud, Imad adDin Zengi II, fled to Aleppo at the court of Nur adDin. The latter, who was waiting for an excuse to annex Mosul, conquered Sinjar in September 1170 and besieged Mosul, which surrendered on 22 January 1171. After ousting alMasish, he put Gmshtekin, one of his officers, as governor, leaving Saif udDin nothing but the nominal title of emir. The latter also married the daughter of Nur adDin. At Nur adDin's death May 1174, Gmshtekin went to Damascus to take control of his son and entitled himself of atabeg of Aleppo. Saif udDin rejected his tutorage and restored his independence. The nobles of Damascus, worried by Gmshtekin's increasing power, offered Saif udDin their city, but he could not intervene since he was busy in retaking Mosul. Thenceforth Damascus was given to Saladin.Saladin took control of BiladuSham Syria but Saif udDin wanted to take over Aleppo, so he sent his brother Izz adDin Mas'ud at the head of an army to fight Saladin they met in an area near Hama called Kron Hama Arabic where Saif udDin was defeated. Later he prepared for another battle at Tell Sultan Tell alSultan Arabic near Aleppo, where he was also defeated he went back to Mosul and sent messengers to Saladin offering his alliance, which was accepted.Saif udDin died from tuberculosis, and his brother Izz adDin Mas'ud succeeded him in 1180.

He became Emir of Mosul in 1170 after the death of his father Qutb adDin Mawdud. Saif had been chosen as the successor under the advice of eunuch Abd alMasish, who wanted to keep the effective rule in lieu of the young emir the disinherited son of Mawdud, Imad adDin Zengi II, fled to Aleppo at the court of Nur adDin. The latter, who was waiting for an excuse to annex Mosul, conquered Sinjar in September 1170 and besieged Mosul, which surrendered on 22 January 1171. After ousting alMasish, he put Gmshtekin, one of his officers, as governor, leaving Saif udDin nothing but the nominal title of emir. The latter also married the daughter of Nur adDin. At Nur adDin's death May 1174, Gmshtekin went to Damascus to take control of his son and entitled himself of atabeg of Aleppo. Saif udDin rejected his tutorage and restored his independence. The nobles of Damascus, worried by Gmshtekin's increasing power, offered Saif udDin their city, but he could not intervene since he was busy in retaking Mosul. Thenceforth Damascus was given to Saladin.Saladin took control of BiladuSham Syria but Saif udDin wanted to take over Aleppo, so he sent his brother Izz adDin Mas'ud at the head of an army to fight Saladin they met in an area near Hama called Kron Hama Arabic where Saif udDin was defeated. Later he prepared for another battle at Tell Sultan Tell alSultan Arabic near Aleppo, where he was also defeated he went back to Mosul and sent messengers to Saladin offering his alliance, which was accepted.Saif udDin died from tuberculosis, and his brother Izz adDin Mas'ud succeeded him in 1180.

It was later held by the Wallis family, who sold it in 1730 to John Stephenson, a Newcastle merchant. One of the Stephenson family built Alston, Cumbria Alston market cross. But in 1769 Knarsdale was sold to James Wallace British politician James Wallace, a distinguished lawyer. His son Thomas, for services to his country, was created Thomas Wallace, 1st Baron Wallace Baron Wallace of Knarsdale. The family also owned Featherstone Castle, and John Hodgson antiquary Hodgson described Knarsdale Hall as having declined in importance ''a gentleman's place of the 17th century now and for a long time since occupied by the farmer of the adjoining grounds... The garden walls have lost their trimness, the malt kilns and the brewhouse are gone''. Today, however, the stone buildings on top of a high mound dominate the scene and are strongly built. The mullioned windows seem to have been inserted into an older hall. nameRowland Governance Knarsdale is in the House of Commons of the United constituency of Hexham UK Parliament Geography Demography Economy Landmarks Transport Education Religious sites The church is dedicated to Jude the Apostle St Jude, and Hodgson saw it in a ruinous condition, with stone lying about. It had been rebuilt in the seventeenth century, and old grave slabs were used in the building. In 1833, however, it was rebuilt at a cost of 300 and a new rectory was erected at this time. On the south wall of the church, beneath the sundial, is a stone carved with ''Erected 1833. Rev. Thomas Bewsher, Rector. William Parker and Joseph Richardson, Church Wardens. Enlarged 1882. Vestry and Porch added 1906''.

He also operated steamboats on the Kootenay River in Montana and on the Stikine River in western British Columbia. Steam navigation in the Rocky Mountain Trench which runs through the East Kootenay region was closely linked to Armstrong's personality and career. In addition to being a steamboat captain, Armstrong was also a prospector, whitewater boat pilot and guide in the Big Bend Country Big Bend country of the Columbia River. name Freeman lifeArmstrong had been born in Sorel, Quebec about 1859. He moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba Winnipeg in 1881, and then came west working with a Canadian Pacific Railway surveying crew in the Columbia Valley from Cranbrook, British Columbia Cranbrook to Golden. name Cooper R. Freeman, a journalist, adventurer, moviemaker, and football coach, came to know Armstrong well in 1920 during a boat trip down the Columbia. Freeman described Armstrong, and as of the most picturesque personalities in the pioneering history of British Columbia at 2021 of steam sternwheeler steamboat, near Golden, BC 1887. A member of the First Nations. possibly serving as a crewman, is also shown near the steamer.ImageFrank P Armstrong at wheel of steamboat Duchess, 1887, near Golden P. Armstrong at the helm of Duchess sternwheeler 1886 ''Duchess'', 1887In 1882 Armstrong homesteaded on the east side of Columbia Lake and planted potatoes, with the plan of selling them to the workers building the CPR downriver at Golden. He built two flatbottomed boats, called bateau  to transport his crop on the river. Armstrong decided a steamboat would be a good way to tow the bateaux back upstream. He arranged to have steam engines shipped west from a steam ferry built in 1840 that operated at his home town in Quebec. Once the engines arrived, and a boiler could be located, Armstrong assembled a steamboat from miscellaneous planks and timbers that were lying around at an old sawmill. The result was the Duchess sternwheeler 1886 ''Duchess'', launched in 1886 at Golden. Two early passengers wrote that her appearance was decrepit and Armstrong himself later agreed that she was pretty crude steamboat. name Downs name BasinRecord Patrick Armstrong ''Basin Record'' Newsletter of the Columbia Basin Institute of Regional History, Vol 2, No.1, at page 3 accessed 11262008 the second steamboat 1888 at Golden at Golden, BC, ca 1888''Duchess'' sank at least once, but Armstrong was eventually able to raise her from the river. He then applied the oddshaped steamer to make enough money in 1887 to have a new sternwheeler built, also called Duchess sternwheeler 1888 ''Duchess''. Armstrong hired the veteran shipbuilder Alexander Watson, of Victoria, British Columbia Victoria, BC to build the new steamer, which although small, was welldesigned and looked like a steamboat. Armstrong also had built a second steamer, Marion which although smaller than the second ''Duchess'', needed only six inches of water to run in. This was an advantage in the often shallow waters of the Columbia above Golden, where as Armstrong put it, river's bottom was often very close to the river's top at 101 BaillieGrohman CanalImageLock at Canal Flats, BC lock at the BaillieGrohman Canal, ca 1889. Armstrong deliberately destroyed these lock gates in making the transit of North Star sternwheeler 1897 ''North Star'' through the canal in 1902.A curious feature of the Rocky Mountain Trench is that two of the major rivers that flow through it, the Columbia River Columbia, flowing north, and the Kootenay River Kootenay flowing south, are separated by only about a mile of low marshy prairie at a place now known as Canal Flats, British Columbia Canal Flats. As the name implies, a canal shipping canal was built across Canal Flats by William Adolf Baillie Grohman William Adolf BaillieGrohman, a European adventurer and promoter from wealthy and privileged background. The canal was completed in 1889, but it was only used three times by steamboats, every time under the command of Captain Armstrong. name Downs name Timmen Fritz, ''Blow for the Landing A Hundred Years of Steam Navigation on the Waters of the West'', at 8788, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, ID 1973 1893, Armstrong built Gwendoline at Hansen's Landing on the Kootenay River, and took the vessel through the canal north to the shipyard at Golden to complete her fitting out. name Downs By this time it appears that the canal had been damaged or deteriorated to the boat where at least some of the transit of ''Gwendoline'' had to be accomplished by pulling the vessel of the water, partially dismantling the boat, and pulling her along on rollers. sources state that the entire northbound transit was made on rollers, and ''Gwendoline'' was not partially dismantled, but rather had never been fully completed at Hansen's Landing. See Moore, D.M., Riverboating on the Kootenay. Over the winter, Armstrong, it is reported, was able to prevail on the provincial government to expend funds to repair the canal. In late May 1894 Armstrong returned the completed ''Gwendoline'' back to the Kootenay River, this time transiting normally the rehabilitated canal. name Downs name Timmen name CrowsnestTimeline Virtual Crowsnest Highway regional history website, Line for Southwestern Canada source states that the southbound transit was possible only because of a luckily high level of water in the canal, and mention nothing about repair. Moore, D.M., Riverboating on the Kootenay canal remained unused until 1902, when Armstrong brought North Star sternwheeler 1897 ''North Star'' north from the Kootenay to the Columbia. The transit of ''North Star'' was only made possible by the destruction, by dynamite, of the lock water transport lock at the canal.Mining boom on the upper Kootenay RiverA mining boom along the upper Kootenay river in the early 1890s led to a demand for shipping to transport miners and supplies into, and ore out of, the region surrounding the river. The Great Northern Railway U.S. Great Northern Railway at Jennings, Montana was the nearest downriver railhead for upper Kootenay shipping.Armstrong moved south from the Columbia to the Kootenay, and built the small sternwheeler Gwendoline at Hansen's Landing, about north of the present community of Wasa, British Columbia Wasa. Instead of taking the ore south to the Jennings, Armstrong's plan was to move the ore north across Canal Flats and then down the Columbia to the CPR railhead at Golden. Armstrong took ''Gwendoline'' through the BaillieGrohman Canal in the fall of 1893 or rolled her across Canal Flats, fitted her out at Golden, and returned through the canal in the spring of 1894. name difficulty of moving ''Gwendoline'' through the Canal convinced Armstrong that the only feasible route was south to Jennings. By early 1896, Armstrong joined with veteran Willamette River steamboat captain James D. Miller steamboat captain James D. Miller and built Ruth sternwheeler 1896 ''Ruth'' named after Armstrong's daughter at Libby, Montana. ''Ruth'' was the largest steamer yet to operate on the upper Kootenay River. name Later, Armstrong and Miller associated with Wardner, and, when their competitors, DePuy and Jones suffered the misfortune of having their new vessel Rustler 125 tons sunk after just six weeks of operation, the three men were able to dominate the river traffic. name Jennings CanyonImageNorth Star sternwheeler on Columbia River ca Star sternwheeler 1897 ''North Star'' ca 1902. This was the largest vessel ever to operate on the Columbia River above Golden, British Columbia Golden, BCOnce in the United States, the Kootenay river, in its natural state before the construction of the Libby Dam, flowed through Jennings Canyon to the settlement of Jennings, Montana. Jennings has almost completely disappeared as a town, but it was near Libby, Montana. Above Jennings, the Kootenay River narrowed as it ran through Jennings Canyon, which was a significant hazard to any river navigation. canyon can no longer be seen, as it is under the waters of Lake Koocanusa formed by the Libby Dam. A particularly dangerous stretch was known as the Elbow. Jennings Canyon was described by Professor Lyman as strip of water, foamingwhite, downhill almost as on a steep roof, hardly wider than steamboat at 280. insurance agent would write a policy for steamboats and cargo transiting the Jennings Canyon. Armstrong once persuaded an agent from San Francisco to consider making a quote on premiums. The agent decided to examine the route for himself, and went on board with Armstrong as the captain's boat shot through the canyon. At the end of the trip, the agent's quote for a policy was onequarter of the value of the cargo. Faced with this quote, Armstrong decided to forgo insurance. name Lyman huge profits to be made seemed to justify the risk. Combined the two steamers could earn 2,000 in gross receipts per day, a lot of money in 1897. name Lyman By comparison, the sternwheeler J.D. Farrell sternwheeler ''J.D. Farrell'' 1897, cost 20,000 to build in 1897. In ten days of operation then, an entire steamboat could be paid for. Armstrong and Miller unsuccessfully tried to get the U.S. Government to finance clearing of some of the rocks and obstructions in Jennings Canyon. Without government help, they hired crews themselves to do the work over two winters, but the results were not of much value. name the work on the channel, every steamboat Armstrong ever took through Jennings Canyon was eventually wrecked in the canyon. The wreck ''Gwendoline'' and ''Ruth'' on May 7, 1897, resulted in the destruction of ''Ruth'' and the sinking of ''Gwendoline'', fortunately with no losses other than severe financial ones. When the new steamer North Star sternwheeler 1897 ''North Star'' was launched a few weeks later, Armstrong was able to make up for some of the losses with 21 completed round trips on the Kootenay between Fort Steele and Jennings before low water forced him to tie up on September 3, 1897. name name Lyman Denison Lyman, ''The Columbia River Its History, Its Myths, Its Scenery, Its Commerce'', at 27781, 293, Putnam, New York NY 1911 1909 edition online here to the Stikine RiverImageMono sternwheeler possibly at Wrangel, Alaska ca with damaged paddlewheel, possibly at Wrangel, Alaska. Frank P. Armstrong and A.F. Henderson built this vessel, which was initially intended for service on the Stikine RiverIn January 1898, Armstrong went north to Alaska to participate in the Klondike Gold Rush, with Armstrong deciding to try his chances at making money as a steamboat captain on the Stikine River then being promoted as the route to the Yukon River gold fields. On the Stikine River, Armstrong served with the famous steamboat captain John Irving steamship captain John Irving. Together with A.F. Henderson, Armstrong built a steamboat, Mono for the Teslin Transportation Company of Victoria, BC. As might be expected from a vessel designed by Armstrong, ''Mono'' had excellent shallow water performance. name Affleck Edwin L., ''A Century of Paddlewheelers in the Pacific Northwest, the Yukon and Alaska'', at page 56, Alexander Nicholls Press, Vancouver, BC 2000 When the Stikine river route collapsed as an alternate access to the Klondike in July 1898, ''Mono'' was taken under tow to St. Michael, Alaska for service on the Yukon River. name was damaged en route, and the towing vessel was forced to return with ''Mono'' to Wrangell, Alaska at the mouth of the Stikine River.

Unfortunately this reference does not go beyond the CPR steamers and does not discuss the other vessels or captains, like Armstrong, who did not work for CPR. name Hacking Norman R., and Lamb, W.

With ''North Star'' gone, steamboating on the upper Kootenay ended for good. name While Armstrong had been engaged in the Kootenay and the Klondike mining booms, a few competitors had appeared on the upper Columbia. In 1899, Harold Ernest Forster Harold E. Forster d.1940 Creek, which flows into the Columbia River near Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia Radium Hot Springs, BC, is named after H.E. Forster. a wealthy mountain climber, businessman, politician and occasional steamboat captain, brought Selkirk sternwheeler 1895 ''Selkirk'' by rail from Shuswap Lake to Golden, where he launched her but used her as a yacht and not, at least initially, as commercial vessel. Also, Captain Alexander Blakely bought the little sidewheeler Pert and operated her on the river. name Downs 1902 Armstrong dismantled ''Duchess''. Armstrong built a new steamer, Ptarmigan using the engines from ''Duchess'' which were by then were over 60 years old.Service in the Great WarMany men from British Columbia served in World War I which began in 1914. Steamboat men were no exception, even Armstrong although he could easily have stayed home because of his age. Instead, Armstrong supervised British river transport in the Middle East, on the Nile River Nile and Tigris River Tigris rivers. The Tigris in particular was in a difficult and hardfought theater of war. Armstrong was not the only one of the small community of steamboat men of Golden to serve. Armstrong's apprentice, John Blakely 18891963, the son of his former competitor, enlisted and went to Europe, where he became one of only six survivors when his ship was torpedoed in the English Channel. name Downs Art, ''Paddlewheels on the Frontier The Story of British Columbia and Yukon Sternwheel Steamers'', at pages 100112, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1972 of steam navigation on the upper Columbia riverImageAbandoned sternwheeler at Golden BC ca sternwheelers at boatyard at Golden, BC. Larger steamer is probably ''Selkirk'', with apparently a smaller vessel unidentified behind, ca 1920The construction of railroads and the economic dislocations caused by the war had doomed steamboats as a method of transportation on the upper Columbia.

In 194748 it aired on Sundays at 2 p.m. mysteries were produced and syndicated 194548 to individual local radio stations as a program to sell advertising to local merchants or trade the advertising announcements for goods, services or premiums, such as prizes awarded to listeners in radio station contests or promotions. To facilitate personalizing the shows to individual stations and insert the local ads, the producers put musical interludes in the shows with enough time for a local announcer to introduce the episode, present the advertiser's message and wrap things up with other local information.Each 30minute episode featured five minimysteries dramatized with actors, organ music and sound effects. Solutions to each mystery were then suggested by a panel of listeners and studio guests. The panelists sometimes shared a common background for example, on the April 14, 1949 program, the amateur sleuths were gas industry officials. Gas Association Monthly''.

Organist Rosa Rio provided the music.While the premise was simple, the mysteries were well written, requiring some thought to come up with the right answer.

An army of the First French Empire and several foreign auxiliaries including Polish insurgents of France besieged the Kingdom of Prussia Prussian fortified town of Koobrzeg Kolberg, the only remaining Prussianheld fortress in the Province of Pomerania 16531815 Prussian province of Pomerania. The siege was not successful and was lifted upon the announcement of the Treaties of Tilsit peace of Tilsit.After Kingdom of Prussia Prussia lost the Battle of JenaAuerstedt in late 1806, First French Empire French troops marched north into Prussian Pomerania. Fortified Stettin Szczecin surrendered without battle, and the province became occupied by the French forces. Kolberg resisted, and the implementation of a French siege was delayed until March 1807 by the freikorps of Ferdinand von Schill operating around the fortress and capturing the assigned French commander of the siege, Claude During these months, the military commander of Kolberg, Lucadou, and the representative of the local populace, Nettelbeck, prepared the fortress's defensive structures.The French forces commanded by Pietro Teuli Teuli, composed primarily of troops from Napoleonic Italy Italy, succeeded in encircling Kolberg by midMarch. Napoleon Bonaparte Napoleon put the siege force under the command of Louis Henri Loison Loison Frederick William III of Prussia Frederick William III entrusted August Neidhardt von Gneisenau Gneisenau with the defense. In early April, the siege forces were for a short time commanded by Edouard Mortier Mortier, who had marched a large force from Siege of Stralsund 1807 besieged Swedish Stralsund to Kolberg but was ordered to return when Stralsund's defenders gained ground. Other reinforcements came from states of the Confederation of the Rhine Kingdom of Wrttemberg, Saxon duchies and the Duchy of Nassau, the Kingdom of Holland, and France.With the western surroundings of Kolberg flooded by the defenders, fighting concentrated on the eastern forefield of the fortress, where Wolfsberg sconce had been constructed on Lucadou's behalf. Aiding the defense from the nearby Baltic Sea were a British and a Swedish Empire Swedish vessel. By late June, Napoleon massively reinforced the siege forces to bring about a decision. The siege force then also concentrated on taking the port north of the town. On 2 July, fighting ceased when Prussia had agreed on an unfavourable peace after her ally Russian Empire Russia suffered a decisive defeat Battle of Friedland at Friedland. Of the twenty Prussian fortresses, Kolberg was one of the few remaining in Prussian hands until the war's end. The battle became a myth in Prussia and was later used by Nazi propaganda efforts. While prior to World War II the city commemorated the defendants, it started to honor the commander of the Polish troops after 1945, when the city became part of a Polish state.PreludeWithin two weeks after the Battle of JenaAuerstedt 14 October 1806, Napoleon Grande Arme had pursued the defeated Royal Prussian Army of the Napoleonic Wars Royal Prussian Army Capitulation of Pasewalk to Pasewalk in Province of Pomerania 16531815 Prussian Pomerania. The provincial capital Stettin now Szczecin, one of twenty Prussian fortresses, Capitulation of Stettin capitulated on 29 October the province's only fortress remaining in Prussian hands. Pierre Thouvenout was appointed French governor of Pomerania and sent his envoy Mestram to accept Kolberg's expected capitulation and take control of it.On 8 November 1806, Mestram met with the Prussian commander of Kolberg Louis Maurice de Lucadou Ludwig Moritz von Lucadou before its walls. Lucadou's refusal to hand over the fortress came as a surprise to the French generals and the Prussian administration in Stettin, who had already pledged allegiance to the French it further led part of the defeated Prussian army to take refuge in Kolberg and reinforce the two musketeer battalions of the von Owstien and von Borcke regiments and the 72 guns garrisoned there. Lucadou ordered the Persante Parseta river west of Kolberg to be dammed up to flood the area around the fortress, and arranged the construction of Wolfsberg Sconce east of the town. Coordination of these measures with Joachim Nettelbeck, representative of the Kolberg citizens, was however impaired by the latter's personal grievances against Lucadou.Among the Prussian soldiers who had retreated to Kolberg after Jena and Auerstedt was secondelieutenant Ferdinand von Schill, who after his recovery from a severe head injury in the house of Kolberg senator Westphal was ordered to patrol the areas west of the fortress with a small cavalry unit. Supplied with information about French movements by local peasants, he succeeded in capturing a number of French officers and soldiers, gathering food and financial supplies in neighboring towns and villages, and recruiting volunteers to his unit from inside and outside Kolberg.Schill's victory in the skirmish of Glzow 7 December 1806 though insignificant from a military point of view, was widely noted as the first Prussian success against the French army while Prussian king Frederick William III of Prussia Frederick William III praised Schill as the of man now valued by the fatherland Napoleon referred to him as a kind of brigand miserable, qui est une espce de brigand As a consequence of these successes and Schill's increasing fame, Prussian king Frederick William III of Prussia Frederick William III ordered him to establish a freikorps on 12 January 1807, which in the following months defended the fortress against French attacks allowing its defenders to complete their preparations for the expected siege with Swedish Empire Swedish and British support via the Baltic.Time for preparation was needed since Kolberg lacked sufficient defensive structures, manpower and armament to withstand a siege. The defensive works of the fortress had been neglected, only the port and Kirchhof sconce had been prepared for defense when Prussia feared war with Russia and Sweden in 1805 and 1806, but they had been disarmed in September. nameHoepfner449 By early December 1806, the Kolberg garrison numbered 1,576 men, nameHoepfner455 but increased steadily during the next months due to the arrival of Prussian troops and new recruits from nearby areas. nameHoepfner456 Armament shortages were in part relieved by Charles XIII of Sweden, who sent rifle components from which local gunsmiths made 2,000 new rifles. nameHoepfner457 As of late October 1806, a total of 72 guns were mounted on Kolberg's walls nameHoepfner449 58 metaliron cannons 8x 24 4x 20 40x 12 6x 6 six iron howitzers 10 and eight iron Mortar weapon mortars 5x 50 3x 25 in addition, there were four mobile 3pounder cannons. nameHoepfner450 While a convoy with artillery reinforcements was held up and captured by French forces near Stettin, nameHoepfner450 twelve 12pounder cannons reached Kolberg from the Prussian fortress of Danzig and the Swedish fortress of Stralsund, who each sent six guns. nameHoepfner454 Since no further artillery reinforcements came in, the Kolberg garrison mounted an additional 92 guns on the walls which previously had been deemed unusable and withdrawn from service these guns were positioned at the flanks at it was speculated that they might still serve to fire rocks and canister shots at short distances. nameHoepfner454 Six guns captured by Schill's freikorps were also sent to Kolberg. VictorPerrin, whom Napoleon Bonaparte had entrusted with taking Kolberg, was captured by Schill's forces in Arnswalde 12 January detained in Kolberg and later exchanged against Prussian general Gebhard Leberecht von Blcher. With VictorPerrin captured, the attack on Kolberg was to be led by Pietro Teuli Pietro Pierre Teuli's Italian division, who in February began the march on the fortress from Stettin. Schill's freikorps further delayed the French advance by provoking several skirmishes and battles, the largest of which took place near Naugard Nowogard. Teuli reached the Kolberg area by early March, and by the mid of the month 14 March had cleared the surrounding villages of Schill's forces and encircled the to AprilWhen the French encirclement of Kolberg rendered Schill's strategy moot, Lucadou sent three cavalry units to aid the Krockow freikorps in the Siege of Danzig 1807 defense of Danzig, while Schill departed to aid in the Siege of Stralsund 1807 defense of Stralsund in Swedish Pomerania. The suburbs, most notably Geldernerviertel, were burned down as it was customary.Because of the delay in the French advance, Napoleon replaced Teuli as the commander of the siege forces with division general Louis Henri Loison Frederick William III replaced Lucadou as the commander of the fortress with major August Neidhardt von Gneisenau after complaints by Nettelbeck and out of considerations for an envisioned British landfall at Kolberg he feared that a Frenchborn commander might irritate his British supporters, while on the other hand Gneisenau had been in British service during the American Revolutionary War.In April, Napoleon withdrew the forces of douard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier Edouard Mortier from the siege of Stralsund and sent them to take Kolberg, however, Mortier soon had to return when the defenders of Stralsund pushed the remaining French troops out of Swedish Pomerania.The French siege army was reinforced by troops from Kingdom of and Saxon states SaxeCoburgSaalfeld, SaxeGothaAltenburg, SaxeMeiningen, SaxeHildburghausen, and SaxeWeimar, as well as a Duchy of Warsaw Polish regiment. Fiddian Reddaway, Cambridge History of Poland, Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 1971, pg. 228 The Saxon and Wrttemberg regiments were part of the army of the Confederation of the Rhine, which like the Kingdom of Italy Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, whose troops were already present at the siege was a French client.

The emperor invited Dabrowski and Wybicki to appeal to the Polish people to revolt but made no commitment to support Polish independence. ... Wybicki and Dabrowski called on their countrymen to rise up. Many Poles ... supported the proclamation and welcomed the French. ... An insurrection quickly liberated western Poland from Prussian rule. In early November 1806, Marshal Davout seized Poznan and soon Dabrowski entered the city. He ordered conscription and assembled an army of 30,000 men. On 2 January 1807, Napoleon triumphantly entered Warsaw. ... Aware of the enormous power of the Polish nobility, Napoleon intended to acquire its support rather than rely solely on the masses. Indeed, rallying the Polish nobility around his rule was a major characteristic of the Napoleonic government in Poland. ... For the time being, the Emperor delayed his decision on the establishment of a Polish state. He did set up a provisional government, however, to organize the war effort and run the Polish areas conquered from Prussia. 3 After western Poland was liberated from Prussian rule in 1806, General Dombrowski was pg. 4 recalled from Italian service and directed to establish the new Polish army. He began on 16 November 1806. On 29 November, Napoleon directed him to form eight regiments of infantry, each with two bataillons.

At a cost of more than eight million marks, it was the most expensive German film of the Second World War. Leiser, Nazi Cinema p128 Part of the plot did not match the eventsfor example, while the actual siege had ended because Prussia surrendered, in the movie it ended because the French generals concluded Kolberg could not be taken. Leiser, ''Nazi Cinema'' p. 1256 187,000 soldiers, 6,000 sailors and 4,000 horses were drawn from the front for the production of the movie. huge numbers originate from Harlan's memoirs. Several authors consider them exaggerated.

'''Adbhutananda''' died 1920, born '''Rakhturam''', was a direct monastic disciple of Ramakrishna, a Mysticism mystic of nineteenth century Bengal. He is familiarly known as '''Latu Maharaj''' among the followers of Ramakrishna. Adbhutananda was the first monastic disciple to come to Ramakrishna. While most of Ramakrishna's direct disciples came from the Bengali intelligentsia, Adbhutananda's lack of formal education made him unique amongst them. He was a servant boy of a devotee of Ramakrishna, and he later became his disciple. Though unlettered, Adbhutananda was considered as a monk with great spiritual insight by Ramakrishna's followers, and Swami regarded him as greatest miracle of Ramakrishna name Biography Early life Adbhutananda was born in NorthEastern India in the Chhapra district of Bihar, around the middle of the nineteenth century. name He was given the name Rakhturam, meaning who is protected by Lord Rama His parents were poor, humble villagers. Both his father and mother died before Rakhturam was five years old and he was left in the care of an uncle who was affectionate towards him. Lived with them'', p.395 up in the village, Rakhturam led a carefree life, tending cows and sheep in the fields. In later years, he said, used to wander freely with the cowherd boys. How simple and guileless they were You can't have real joy unless you are like that. Poverty forced Rakhturam and his uncle to travel to Calcutta in search of a livelihood. Rakhturam came in contact with Ramachandra Datta, a householder devotee of Ramakrishna, and he joined as his servant. name Lived with Them'', p.396 As a servant, Rakhturam was considered energetic and faithful. Rakhturam became known as in his new Calcutta surroundings, and he was called by that name thereafter. name Meetings with Ramakrishna Ramakrishna lived at the Dakshineswar Kli Temple, a few miles north of Calcutta, on the eastern bank of the Ganges. Ram Chandra Datta, Latu's employer, was one of the first householder disciples to visit Ramakrishna. Datta loved to speak about Ramakrishna and his sayings and Latu heard about Ramakrishna from him and was attracted by Ramakrishna's teachings, It is reported that inspired by the teachings of Ramakrishna, he was often found lying covered with his blanket, quietly wiping tears from his eyes thinking of God. name Lived with Them'', p.397 Latu waited eagerly for an opportunity to meet Ramakrishna, and he met Ramakrishna on a Sunday in 1879 or 1880.When Ramakrishna saw Latu, he reportedly said to Ramchandra that Latu had signs in him. and it is reported that when Ramakrishna touched him, Latu entered an ecstatic state, trickled from his eyes and his lips began to quiver with emotion and he gradually returned to normal state of consciousness. name Latu began to visit Ramakrishna regularly, and he lost the enthusiasm with which he worked before at Datta's house. In June 1881, he joined Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar as his personal attendant and helper. Lived with Them'', p.400 He also used to help Sarada Devi in her chores. Lived with Them'', p.433 With Ramakrishna in Dakshineswar At Dakshineswar Latu began a life of rigorous spiritual discipline under Ramakrishna's guidance, and also continued his service as his servant to him. His day began, first seeing Ramakrishna and saluting him. As Latu had received no formal schooling, Ramakrishna hoped that he might acquire at least a rudimentary education, so he tried to teach him the Bengali language Bengali alphabets himself. However, Latu's Bihari people Bihari accent was different from that of a Bengali, and he could not read even the first vowel correctly. Ramakrishna corrected him repeatedly with much amusement, and the experiment was later discontinued. lived with them'', pp.401402 According to Saradananda, Ramakrishna's monastic disciple Latu was seen and meditating the whole night and sleeping during the day. His life was a literal example of the teaching of the ''Bhagavad Gita Gita'''In that which is night to all beings, the man of selfcontrol is awake and where all beings are awake, there is night for the sage who sees 2.69. Lived with Them'', p.404 At Shyampukur and Cossipore In the middle of 1885 Ramakrishna's throat became sore, which later developed into Head and neck cancer throat cancer. To conveniently treat him, the devotees moved Ramakrishna from Dakshineswar to Shyampukur, in North Calcutta. Latu, being his personal attendant went with him. He later moved on with Ramakrishna to Cossipore on 11 December 1885. He took care of nursing Ramakrishna during his final days, reminiscing about which Latu said, the Master was our worship. We didn't need any other spiritual disciplines. lived with them'', p.411 Latu received an ochre cloth and rosary from Ramakrishna. lived with them'', p.412 After Ramakrishna's death on 16 August 1886, Latu went on a pilgrimage visiting Vrindaban, Varanasi, Ayodhya with Sarada Devi, and other lay and monastic disciples of Ramakrishna. lived with them'', p.413 At Calcutta group photo.jpg  thumb   right   Adbhutananda with Girish Chandra Ghosh, Mahendranath Gupta and other disciples and devotees of RamakrishnaAfter Ramakrishna's passing away, Narendra Vivekananda and some of the other disciples established the first Ramakrishna monastery at Baranagore in an old, dilapidated house. Here some of the disciples including Naren took their monastic vows and were engaged in the study of the scriptures, practicing meditation and austerity. lived with them'', p.414 Latu joined them later in 1887 and accepted the monastic vows. Vivekananda gave him the monastic name Adbhutananda, meaning, who finds bliss in the wonderful nature of the tman Hinduism Atman. lived with them'', p.415 According to his brother monks, Adbhutananda lead a very austere life at the monastery practicing meditation and ''japa''. He led the life of a wandering monk around Calcutta area, unattached to people and places. Sometimes he stayed at the home of other householder devotees, but most often was found living simply on the bank of the Ganges. Sometimes he stayed at Alambazar Math and Belur Math. lived with them'', p.417 also went on several pilgrimages to North India with his brother disciples including Vivekananda. lived with them'', p.422 In 1903 he moved to the house of Balaram Bose, a householder devotee of Ramakrishna and stayed there till 1912. Here he was visited by people from different walks of lifejudges, doctors, teachers, learned monks, and householders for spiritual instructions. Lived with Them'', p.428 At Varanasi In October 1912 Adbhutananda left Balaram's hose for Varnasi, never to return again. Lived with Them'', p.434 Here he first stayed at Ramakrishna Advaita Ashrama and later at different locations. As was characteristic of him, he was so often absorbed in meditation that he rarely had fixed time for meals. In Varanasi, he continued to teach and people visited him for spiritual instructions. Lived with Them'', p.435 Last days During his last days, according to his devotees, Adbhutananda seemed to be gradually withdrawing from the world. He spoke occasionally with people, and when he spoke it was generally of spiritual matters. As reported by this disciples, his body, which had once been remarkably strong, had been gradually weakened by age and years of intense spiritual disciplines and his indifference towards the physical world. Lived with Them'', p.436 During the last few years he suffered from diabetes and minor physical ailments. During the last year of his life he developed a blister on this leg, which developed into gangrene. name Lived with Them'', p.437 He was visited by his brother and Saradananda. name Eventually the gangrene worsened and the doctors operated several times on successive days, but were unsuccessful. Adbhutananda died in the holy city of Varnasi at 1210 p.m on Saturday, 24 April 1920. name Regarding his death, Turiyananda wrote in a letter to Josephine MacLeod, an American devotee of Vivekananda, showed no signs of pain during his illness. But the wonder of all wonders was that after this death when his body was placed in a sitting position to conform with some of the funeral rites, we found him looking so beautiful, so serene, so full of peace and bliss. His face beamed with light and an intelligence unspeakable, as if he were taking leave from his friends for the last time with an exhortation of affectionate benediction. name Lived with Them'', p.438 Teachings and sayings Adbhutananda, being illiterate, did not write any books his teachings and sayings have been recorded by these disciples and devotees. Adbhutananda taught that true being in man is ever free, ever pure, and remains ever untouched by good or evil. Good and evil have no absolute reality. They exist only so long as man identifies himself with the ego, the false self. When the ego is completely annihilated, man is freed from the false knowledge of duality or relativityof good and evil. His other teachings were, What is the use of prayer and meditation if there is no dependence on Him Everything else is useless if this is lacking. It is a great sin to find fault with others. Those who do never do a good act themselves, who easily see defects in others and energetically spread rumors. It is better to continue calling on the Lord devotedly than to know, speak, and preach thousand and one religious cants and shibboleths.

Please ''do not modify'' the archive below and instead participate in discussions at '''WTMOSNUM'''. Thank you from pages that are automatically signed Three issues have been causing disruption on this talk page and on MOSNUM itself, and it is high time they were dealt with more formally. Please indicate ''support'' or ''oppose'' beneath each proposal, followed by a brief comment if you wish, and your signature. Please note that any proposal to allow the of only dates of birth and death would require a change to the following requirement in MOSNUM, and is not under consideration in this RfC in article body text should all have the same format. UserTony1  color User talkTony1  color 1350, 23 November 2008 UTCTOCProposal 1 A return to the linking of dates and date fragmentsThat the following text in MOSNUM Dates years, months, day and month, full dates should not be HelpLink linked, unless there is a reason to do so. changed to Years, months, daysmonths, and full dates should normally be HelpLink linked. I think that there would be no point at all to make full dates linked. It could just be considered a waste of time and space. User 1318, 3 December 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' There has never been a requirement to link these. The strange addiction to date links is largely a sideeffect of autoformatting. User talkLightmouse talk 1501, 23 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' for all of the reasons that have been put forward over the past two years. UserTony1  color User talkTony1  color 1517, 23 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose with reservation''' we should link to dates, as to other words and phrases, when the link is useful to readers. Wider linking exists only for the purposes of autoformatting, which is a mistake. But at the same time, ''normally do not'' should not be strengthened to, or construed as, ''never'' indeed, it should be moderated slightly, since there are clear classes where such links are useful to at least some readers which is why we are having this discussion. 1711, 23 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose'''. There are very few instances when linking dates is useful. Making links the default is a ''very'' bad idea. UserPohta ceam pohtit Pcap UsertalkPohta ceam pohtit  1805, 23 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose'''. They were only linked to support autoformatting. Now that is deprecated there is no need to litter articles with dozens of redundant and distracting links. UserJohn John User talkJohn talk 1817, 23 November 2008 UTCI'm not going to argue about this proposalonly raising a likely point of fact. I did some brief research and concluded that datelinking was done before the advent of The latter seems to have been in November 2003. I picked three articles which I knew were older than that and I did find revisions with linked dates from 20012002. I'd be curious how typical these results are and would have liked to do a complete search of old revisions but I don't have the resources for that. User 1906, 23 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' Was someone serious when they proposed this one One should only link to articles that are germane and have a particular relevancy to the subject matter. It would be bankrupt logic to think that just because these lists of random trivia have a little bit of ''everything'' under the sun, that a reader researching, for instance Jonas Salk should be able to traipse through October 28 October Mr. Salk was bornand maybe perhaps find something related to vaccines or doctors. style L Greg L''' UsertalkGregL talk 1932, 23 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' Strongly.

UserMalcolm Schosha Malcolm Schosha User talkMalcolm Schosha talk 2131, 23 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose'''. Such links provide nothing useful to the reader, and only serve to confuse. UserPhil Bridger Phil Bridger User talkPhil Bridger talk 2209, 23 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose'''. Useless links that devalue the worth of the feature.

No such greater clarity is needed for dates or years. User talkSMP0328. talk 2228, 23 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' What purpose these links has is beyond me, and when starting here on the Wiki I found it very confusing that dates were linked to pahes with random information. 2243, 23 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' per Tony's arguments, titled of dateautoformatting User talkApoc2400 talk 2332, 23 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' per WPCONTEXT.

Random context consisting of unrelated events is not necessary in an encylopedia. 2336, 23 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' My thirtieth edit to Wikipedia was to remove excessive date links from an article. They provided no information relevant to the article. I have been following this date linking discussion on MOSNUM for the past few months.

What happened to the RfC at WikipediaManual of Style dates and numbersDate Linking RFCUser2008Olympian 0552, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' per above arguments.

We can revisit the change later, once the outofprocess change of the guideline is reverted. UserArthur Rubin Arthur Rubin User talkArthur Rubin talk 0950, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' there is a reason to do so means that the rare occasion when linking is useful can be catered for, otherwise linking lowers readability UserDavid Woodward David Woodward User talkDavid Woodward talk 1053, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' no reason to change this very longstanding principle don't know when it came in, but it's been operating at least since I can remember please note that this is not about the autoformatting links. User talkKotniski talk 1103, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose'''. Useless proposal. UserRuslik0 Ruslik User talkRuslik0 talk 1335, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose'''. Datelinks dilute the value of other, more useful links in the article. User talkKaranacs talk 1449, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''', no arguments given to not adhere to WPCONTEXT. Of course, what ''is'' and what ''is'' in this instance might be discussed. UserJao Jao User talkJao talk 1510, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose'''. Overlinking makes articles harder to read, this one is a User 1521, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' Linking of full dates in a nonGregorian calendar, combined with a user date preference setting of creates falsehoods. Also, it is not uncommon to mention the same date several times in an article, and if date linking is acceptable at all for the purpose of guiding readers to related articles, only the first mention of a date should be linked, so it is wrong to say dates should normally be linked. UserGerry Ashton Gerry Ashton User talkGerry Ashton talk 1637, 24 November 2008 UTC I '''oppose''' this linking, be this interpreted as a change to the status quo or otherwise I am aware of the bugzilla report. User talkKnepflerle talk 1653, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose'''. I've also thought that the date linking status quo was pretty dumb, honestly. This should cut down on the overlinking. If there's a patch to fix the autoformating problem in the pipe, by all means get it going, but I don't think that we need to wait on it either. If it becomes desirable to link the dates later, it will be easy enough to do so. UsertalkHiDrNick  style style 1723, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose both the change and the original''' When I first joined wikipedia date linking was the norm. But it seemed to serve no useful purpose. There was no ability to see what happened on for instance 21 November 1963, etc. Date linking was just one of the strange quirks of wikipedia at that time. Having said this, the mass unlinking was also a bit pointless. I don't mind if some articles have linked dates though it would be more useful if they were linked to articles on a full ddmmmyyyy User talkToddy1 talk 1822, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose'''. I have never encountered a situation where the link led anywhere relevant, useful, or even interesting. Date autoformatting was a halfbaked solution to a nonproblem which hid the real problem that editors didn't see what regular readers saw. It ought to be consigned to the rubbish bin, not resurrected. UserMalleus Fatuorum Malleus 2007, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''', as a list of what happened on, say, the date of 25 September is almost never relevant to an article which happens to mention an event which occurred on that date. '''UserIt Is Me Here  color Is Me Here Is Me Here  color Is Me Here  color 2032, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''', per reasons above, this issue has already achieved broad consensus. UserKaldari Kaldari User talkKaldari talk 2048, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' because overlinking is bad and the article linked to isn't useful. User talkTempshill talk 2051, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose.''' Autoformatting is nice, but the best way to get there is to adapt the software so that autoformatting is possible without linking. With the total amount of effort that has gone into this debate, a complete novice could probably have learned enough about programming by now to simply make that change to the MediaWiki software. User 2131, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose with clarification''' Need to decide when date linking is appropriate but linking all dates is bad. UserMasem M size 2222, 24 November 2008 UTC'''oppose'''. A handful of dates are notable, e.g. 1492 or April 1st, but even then only in context. UserPhilcha Philcha User talkPhilcha talk 2344, 24 November 2008 UTC'''Pileon oppose''' Very selective linking is on occasion acceptable, in the spirit of wpIAR, but on the whole, no.

UserRyan4314  color color User talkRyan4314 talk 0052, 25 November 2008 UTC'''Support''' at least in most historical articles, year might give the right perspective to the reader. It is also interesting to know else happened in that year User talkTakenakaN talk 0113, 25 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' I am against any ''inappropriate'' imposition of uniformity. This matter should be more sensitive to context, and to the type of article one is editing. color  '''  T 0143, 25 November 2008 UTC'''oppose''' such linking adds nothing but clutter to articles and serves no useful user purpsoe. Any such links that currently exist should be removed by any and all means, manually or in bulk. If a reader wants to know what else happened on a day, they can easily search for it. UserHmains Hmains User talkHmains talk 0401, 25 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''', ugly and uninformative. UserTimVickers Tim Vickers User talkTimVickers talk 0435, 25 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' The respective date and year article linked do not currently add context. User 1744, 25 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' I do not see how random lists of what happened on a date add context to an article. User talkEaldgyth Talk 2213, 25 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose'''. No reason to link to dates unless there's a specific event that happened on the , in which case, you should link to the event rather than the 0157, 26 November 2008 UTC'''Opposed.''' The value of datelinking i.e., autoformatting is exceptionally limited, and it has never been a requirement in any case. However, the case for linking years in XXXX is a separate issue in that it involves more than just style issues. UserAskari Mark Askari Mark talkAskari Mark Talk 0316, 26 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' for all the reasons this was abandoned in the first place. UserJimp J 1006, 26 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' date linking only takes focus away from the links around it, and sends readers to completely irrelevant articles that add no context to the article being read. Dates should only be linked when sufficient context is present. UserSteve  style smallcaps talkSteve T 1044, 26 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' Can't see the advantage and the disadvantage is overlinking pointlessly.

Linking all dates is distracting and useless. style solid blackpadding1px style 1434, 26 November 2008 UTC '''Oppose''' Linking all dates is like linking all occurences of anyevery linkable term a distraction. It makes sense to link dates to relevant timelines in certain articles e.g. an article on the American Declaration of Indepence might pipe link to an article on the timeline of the American Revolution. User talkStuderby talk 1935, 26 November 2008 UTC '''Oppose.''' Linking all dates is timewasting and purposeless. UserBen MacDui  color User talkBen MacDui  color MacDui  color 1957, 26 November 2008 UTC '''Oppose''' The usage of the word without any qualification or hint about what constitutes normality or more importantly abnormality is a recipe for disaster.

UserHans Adler Hans Adler User talkHans Adler talk 2304, 26 November 2008 UTC '''Oppose''' Excess links are distracting. Dates should only be linked when there is a specific relevance to the topic at hand. User talkJackARoe talk 2321, 26 November 2008 UTC '''Oppose''' The links are redundant, confusing, and unsightly. We do not need them. UserThe Duke of Waltham Waltham, talkThe Duke of Waltham ''The Duke of'' 0145, 27 November 2008 UTC '''Oppose''' per above. User talkDrKiernan talk 0815, 27 November 2008 UTC '''Oppose''', looks really bad, and the resulting links are irrelevant to an article. No need for autoformatting, the important thing is internal consistency within articles. User talkPunkmorten talk 0818, 27 November 2008 UTC '''Oppose'''. A link to a date article should be subject to the same rules of justifiability as any other link. UserRexxS RexxS User talkRexxS talk 0454, 28 November 2008 UTC '''Oppose'''. The linking of component parts of a date is of little use except in the case of eg. 1 April, but there it would be more useful to link to April Fool's Day, which in turn could link to 1 April as it a recurring yearly date. Linking to a fully YYYYmmdd could be useful to find events occuring on the exact same day, but this has never be done anyway. If this is done, it could be done automatically as there are a finite number 3 combinations of allowed date formatting.

However for new users, of which hopefully we have many, they can be bewildering.

UserCBHA CBHA User talkCBHA talk 1652, 28 November 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' I have a tendency caused by my curiosity I guess to click on every link in a Wikipedia article, to learn more.

But under the present conditions, the proposal that style months, daysmonths, and full dates should normally be linked will only cause irritating of blue as some have so aptly called it.

UserAvenue Avenue User talkAvenue talk 0410, 30 November 2008 UTC '''Support''' Not that it will make a dent here, but comments that date links don't help the reader, or confuses them have no basis in any asserted facts. Doing otherwise means a user's preferences are rendered useless, and unnecessary edits are made by editors changing date formats around. It was a mistake to change the policy first time around, and it's a mistake to not remedy it now. Sadly a majority of these opposes are ''per'' or ''as above'' and are hopefully viewed with care.

WPENGVAR has worked exceptionally well for things like colorcolour, I see no reason that it shouldn't work that well for date formats. The fact that MOSNUM says that an article has been stable in a given style, it should not be converted without a styleindependent reason should help to prevent such wars.

Modern technology is wonderful, but we can't have an writer any more than we can sensibly have an writer There are some things that require human attention. Autoformatting is manually set up anyway and the editor who wishes to go through an article and put round every date, would do the Project a better service by going through and making each date appear in an appropriate format for the article so that it looks right for every reader, not just logged in Wikipedians who have set a preference. style 1px F10 face MT color size User talkSilkTork  1642, 2 December 2008 UTC'''Support''' While I oppose date ''linking'', I support some form of date ''formatting''.

UserCeltic Minstrel Celtic Minstrel talkCeltic Minstrel talk 1738, 9 December 2008 UTC'''Oppose''' for semiautomated. So far the arguments for this have centered on bots encountering unexpected circumstances. Semiautomated scripts and tools such as by definition require human intervention to work an should not cause such issues. talkPhatom87 talk 1622, 10 December 2008 UTC'''Strong Oppose''' Bots keep pages in compliance without manual intervention. There should always be a way to tell a bot to ignore a page in the bot's coding for special cases. User talkTimmccloud talk 2307, 11 December 2008 UTC'''Strongly support''' per the reasoning of UserArthur Rubin Arthur Rubin, and Semiautomatic edits using AWB, for example can be just as disruptive and dangerous as bots. For example, look at the thousands of articles recently edited by Lightmouse using AWB, often at the rate of 1 article every 4 seconds. See this discussion that was closed by an administrator UserReedy Reedy who himself uses AWB to make rapid edits, an apparent conflict of interest. See also this discussion on Reedy's talk page. UserTennis expert Tennis expert User talkTennis expert talk 0601, 12 December 2008 UTC'''Support''' I see bots and users making many errors as well as being unbelievably irritating in their smug belief that they are somehow to this project just because they make lots and lots of unnecessary edits. For those of us who actually ''create'' articles, it's just another example of how wikipedia is fast losing sight of its original agenda. UserDeb Deb User talkDeb talk 1252, 12 December 2008 UTC'''Strong Oppose'''. Editors using Bots do a great job in my opinion. We are already have an approval process for bots and guidelines about doing rapid edits using bots. It is great for the consistency of presntation of the encyclopaedia that there are people who are willing to do these tasks. They ought to be able to get on with bringing articles into line with the MOS. All edits, even from Bots, can be reverted. The worse that can happen is that there is a later consensus to revert in which case the bot edits can be reverted by another bot UserViv Hamilton Viv Hamilton User talkViv Hamilton talk 1522, 12 December 2008 UTCGiven that the MOS is merely a guideline and not a policy, why is it necessary or desirable to have a bot to articles into line with the MOS I have never understood why people or their bots are allowed to force an article to comply with mere MOS recommendations in opposition to the longstanding consensus of the editors of that article. UserTennis expert Tennis expert User talkTennis expert talk 2201, 12 December 2008 UTC I couldn't agree with you more. There are often reasons peculiar to a particular article, subject, field or set of data that make a format that varies from the MoS more suitable quite often it's a rough but workable compromise after an article's editors tried other approaches usually including those recommended by the MoS. An extreme example, in my view, is AWB's flagging of and only for redundancy, when there could be several good reasons to prefer it to alone. ''What a bot is good for is things like cleaning up misspellings rather than variant spellings, although even those cases need human supervision for cases such as misspellings, antique spellings, foreign words, slang or historical punctuation in an original quotation or title.'' Rage against the machine. UserShakescene  Shakescene User talkShakescene talk 2254, 12 December 2008 UTCProof that the MOS is merely a guideline and not mandatory comes from the criteria for an article being classified as a article Such an article has to comply with only a few aspects of the MOS. If the MOS were the article of course would have to comply with all aspects of the MOS. Therefore, it's bankrupt for MOS enforcers to argue that the MOS is mandatory without first actually making it mandatory. UserTennis expert Tennis expert User talkTennis expert talk 0513, 14 December 2008 UTC'''Oppose'''. No need for additional guidelines in this area. User talkEubulides talk 2014, 13 December 2008 UTC POST VOTES ABOVE THIS LINE The problem here is going to be deciding which articles fall into the WPMOSNUM exception of being to use '''January 1, 1970''', which is rather subjective. ''Bots are good at subjective.'' UserSladen Sladen User talkSladen talk 1619, 28 November 2008 UTC While I appreciate the work done by bots, and oppose date linking generally, using a bot to delink dates would necessarily imply that ''all'' linked dates should be unlinked. Surely ''some'' few datelinks should be kept September 11 comes to mind. UserMwanner Mwanner   User talkMwanner Talk 1422, 29 November 2008 UTCThere is no reason to link September 11. The correct link would be September 11 attacks, which a bot should leave alone because teh date is not surrounded by brackets. User talkTruthanado talk 0412, 3 December 2008 UTC I'm disturbed by the large number of '''Oppose'''s I see which state some variant of bots are useful. I don't think that's the question being asked. User talkArimareiji talk 1829, 1 December 2008 UTCSimilarly, I'm disturbed by the large number of '''Support'''s I see that appear to be completely unaware of WPRBA the existing botapproval process. ''No'' bot is allowed to run on Wikipedia to do ''anything'' without explicit permission. The question here has two partsShould real, live, human, ''non''bot editors have to get special permission from a specialinterest group at WT that is, a special exception to the normal process to use an ergonomically friendly script such as Twinkle to make changes that they want to make anywayShould making dates conform with MOSNUM by a nonhuman bot be considered so incredibly special that it requires not just the normal, extensive bot approval process, but ''also'' special permission from the specialinterest group at WTMOSNUM. Compare this rules system, for example, to the way we handle vandal fighting and external link spamming is undoing an error made by a datelinkchanging bot dramatically harder than undoing an error made by ClueBot, or any of the many other bots that run everyday on Wikipedia User 0719, 8 December 2008 UTCPlease remember that Proposal 3 also concerns semiautomatic edits also, which are ''supervised by humans''. User talkDabomb87 talk 0104, 2 December 2008 UTC'''Comment''' I expect to see this revisited in a year or two when a less obtrusive way of doing these things is devised. I think the oppose comments reflect the overuse and the obtrusiveness, not the principle. '''UserDGG DGG''' User talkDGG talk 1811, 10 December 2008 UTC'''Comment'''. The statement that the guideline in article body text should all have the same format somehow eliminates the possibility of linking birth and death dates in biography articles is clearly incorrect. This guideline refers to date ''formatting'', not to linking.What's this deal about ignoring birthdeath dates This does not apply to consistency because it is only within the parentheses in the first sentence, not in the article body text. I don't like date links littered everywhere, but they should be linked at the very top where it's relevant. UserReywas92  style fontsizemedium talkReywas92  style 2131, 16 December 2008 UTCThat's an interesting new use of the word 'relevant' that I hadn't come across before. Charles Darwin, a featured article begins Robert Darwin 12 February 1809 19 April 1882 I looked at 12 February. Among 48 KB of other stuff, it turns out he shares a birthday with Abraham Lincoln and Lolly Badcock relevant I then looked at 1809. It seems Darwin was born the day after Robert Fulton patented the steamboat. Same nonsense at 19 April and 1882. If anybody suggested that articles should have nondate links to that sort of trivia, they'd be laughed at. If I want to see jokes I read Icanhascheezburger, not Wikipedia.
